  <h1>After Best-Picture Fiasco, Two Accountants Will Not Be Invited Back to the Oscars</h1>
  <h2> Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz, the PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants responsible for that major mistake, will no longer be part of the ceremony.</h2>

  <p>Ater the botched best-picture announcement at Sunday night’s Oscars, Academy president Cheryl Boone Isaacs told the Associated Press that both accountants responsible for the flub would not be invited back to work the prestigious awards ceremony. 
  An Academy spokesperson confirmed the decision to Vanity Fair. The PricewaterhouseCoopers veterans, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz,—the only people who knew the winners’ list beforehand, and were responsible for handing the correct envelopes to Oscar presenters—came under fire after La La Land was mistakenly announced as the best-picture winner. 
  The correct winner was Moonlight.
  It was later revealed that Cullinan was responsible for the incident: instead of handing presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway the envelope for best picture, he gave them the back-up envelope for best actress (Emma Stone in La La Land). He was also tweeting about Stone’s win backstage (a possible policy violation) just before handing over the wrong envelope. 
  Dunaway, apparently seeing the movie’s title on the card, disregarded Stone’s name and announced the musical as the night’s big winner.
  Cullinan and Ruiz’s removal is the first major action the Academy has taken to rectify its historic blunder, the likes of which has never been seen before at the Oscars. PwC has taken full responsibility for the incident, issuing two statements after the ceremony and promising an investigation into how such a mistake could have occurred. The Academy issued an apology on Monday, after PwC’s initial statement. 
  “We apologize to the entire cast and crew of La La Land and Moonlight, whose experience was profoundly altered by this error,” the Academy statement reads in part. 
  “We salute the tremendous grace they displayed under the circumstances. To all involved — including our presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, the filmmakers, and our fans watching worldwide — we apologize.” </p>
  
  <p> In a recent interview with KCRW, via The Hollywood Reporter, Oscar producer Michael de Luca painted a picture of a chaotic night backstage after the best-picture catastrophe. “I literally heard, ‘Oh my God! He got the wrong envelope!’ ” De Luca recalled. “And then it was slow motion. You perceive things slowly as the adrenaline rises, and the cortisol floods your system.”
  PwC chairman Tim Ryan is also reportedly offering to take one-on-one meetings with individual members of the Academy’s board of governors in order to preserve the company’s relationship with the film institution, according to T.H.R. PwC has tallied Oscar votes for about 83 years, and is likely seeking to continue its high-profile relationship—this is one way to possibly save face in the midst of an unraveling controversy. Academy C.E.O. Dawn Hudson is willing to set up one-on-one meetings between Ryan and the 54-member board of governors, per T.H.R. The board’s next meeting is on March 28, and it’s likely that the future of PwC’s relationship with the Academy will be a topic of discussion.</p>
